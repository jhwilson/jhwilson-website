Quasicrystals, a beautiful manifestation of something without a strict crystalline symmetry but nonetheless shows order, have won a [Nobel prize](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2011/press-release/) and have recently interested my own work with a dodecagonal graphene quasicrystal making its way into Science[^1].


This led to this beautiful cover in Science[^2]

<div style="text-align:center">
{% include figure.html path="assets/img/F1.large.jpg" caption="Cover image from a Science magazine cover story." class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
</div>

This phenomena is a perfect example of the kind of research I've been doing a lot with these days, and so it inspired the new logo for this website

<div style="text-align:center">
{% include figure.html path="assets/img/quasicrystal_logo.png" caption="Building a Penrose tiling from two sheets of graphene twisted at 30-degrees with respect to each other." class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
</div>

One can tell how this is done: You find the points where two hexagons are on top of each other, put down a point, and connect. There are three shapes: a rhombus, an equilateral triangle, and a square. This can be done along the entire sheet to create an amazing looking pattern. For completeness, we can fill in the rest of the pictured grid to obtain:

<div style="text-align:center">
{% include figure.html path="assets/img/quasicrystal_logo2.png" caption="A fully Penrose tiled sheet." class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
</div>

The pattern starts to look even more intriguing the further out in the tiling you go.
There is much to learn about such physical systems and their quasiperiodic cousins.
