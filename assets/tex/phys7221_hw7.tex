\problem{[20 pts] Kepler Hamiltonian}
Obtain the Hamiltonian and write Hamilton's equations for a particle in the Kepler's potential ($V(r) = - k / r$).

\problem{[20 pts] Hamiltonian for a particle in an electromagnetic field}
Obtain the Hamiltonian and write Hamilton's equations for a charged particle in an electromagnetic field. Show that these equations are equivalent to the ones obtained from the Lagrangian formalism.

\problem{[20 pts] Poisson brackets of angular momentum}
Consider a free particle in three-dimensions, and consider cartesian coordinates. If $L_{i}$ are the components of angular momentum $i = 1,2,3$, compute the following Poisson brackets: $\{L_{i},L_{j}\}$, $\{\mathbf L^{2}, L_{i}\}$.
Are they familiar to you?
